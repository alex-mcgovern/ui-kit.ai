# Introduction

**@ui-kit.ai** is a comprehensive UI framework made for building rich, AI-powered
applications.

## What is @ui-kit.ai?

Not quite. **@ui-kit.ai** is a modern, opinionated UI framework designed to
accelerate the development of AI-powered applications. It is built with a focus
on:

- **AI consumption**: Our MCP server superhcharges LLMs with code samples as
  context.
- **AI experiences**: Primitives for rich chat-based user-experiences.
- **Accessibility**: Built with
  [react-aria-components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria-components/),
  the most accessible primitive UI library.
- **Customizability**: A customizable [tailwindcss v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  theme, with a rich, interactive theme editor.

## How is this different from..?

Inspired by the modern, and pragmatic approach of
libraries like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Radix
UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), and [HeroUI](https://www.heroui.com/),
**@ui-kit.ai** provides a set of clean, composable APIs for with up-to-date
aesthetics.

We ship a single npm package â€” not a copy-paste component toolkit. While highly
customizable, it is designed to be immediately usable out-of-the-box.
